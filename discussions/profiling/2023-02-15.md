### Agenda

Discussing on outside introspection with LibVMI

### Discussions

AV: I looked more in-depth of how LibVMI initializes itself for each VM

AV: I added to this document https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ao1xYSfdBfjlmnlfwdBgC-WpHaXQbHeiG5jueezAf8/edit?usp=sharing 

AV: So at first it initializes the driver interface through libkvmi, which makes the handshake between KVMi and the userspace component

AV: They reccomend only working through libkvmi not the KVMi low-level API

AV: Then it initializes paging (architecture specific)

AV: Then it makes some OS-specific initializations read from a configuration file and populates them into the linux_instance structure: mainly system map, task_struct offsets and page global directory (mm_struct->pgd)

MR: We need to check whether we add these things to Unikraft to mimic a Linux platform or we add Unikraft support for LibVMI

AV: This initialization is done before any other function can be called

AV: I managed to create a Linux VM with the patched KVM and QEMU, and I could check to see what breaks

MR: So all these virtual memory translation functions from LibVMI would not work

MR: Maybe we need to look into LibVMI and add a third platform that is Unikraft and add Unikraft-specific offsets

MR: Great work figuring out all of this

MR: You could try checking if the physical memory functions would work

MR: Do you know why building KVM as a module doesn't work?

AV: The documentation states that you need to build the entire patched kernel, but I haven't actually tried yet

### TODOs and Decisions

AV: Check if the physical memory functions from the LibVMI API work in the PoC

AV: Try and compile KVM as a module
